 Cappuccino
Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. 
Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.

- Cortado
Like yin and yang, a cortado is the perfect balance of espresso and warm steamed milk. The milk is used to cut back on the espressoâ€™s acidity.

Red Eye
Named after those pesky midnight flights, a red eye can cure any tiresome morning. A full cup of hot coffee with an espresso shot mixed in, this will definitely get your heart racing.
